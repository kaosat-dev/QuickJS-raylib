# QuickJS + raylib
[QuickJS](https://github.com/ldarren/QuickJS "QuickJS repo") is a small and embeddable Javascript engine. It can compile Javascript sources to executables with no external dependencies, and supports native modules using the QuickJS C API.
[raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib "raylib repo") is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.

I'm developing a module for QuickJS so you can use raylib from JavaScript and run your game with native performance.

## Installation (wip)
Using Visual Studio Code:
1. Install QuickJS and raylib.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open cloned repo in VS Code.
4. Run the ```build lib``` task.
5. Run the ```start``` task.
